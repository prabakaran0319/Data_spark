# Data Analysis and Visualization Project: Retail Store Insights
This project showcases the end-to-end process of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to derive actionable insights from retail business data. Below is a detailed breakdown of the steps undertaken:

Analyzed retail store data using SQL, Python, and Power BI to uncover insights on store performance, product trends, and regional sales. Used MySQL for data management, formulated SQL queries, cleaned data with Python, and developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to support data-driven decision-making.

# 1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Utilized Python (Jupyter Notebook in VS Code) to clean and preprocess datasets from five CSV files:
- customers.csv
- exchangerates.csv
- products.csv
- sales.csv
- stores.csv
# Key tasks performed:
- Identified and handled missing values (NaN) across all datasets.
- Standardized column names for consistency and ease of use.
- Validated data integrity by ensuring proper formats and accurate entries.

# 2.Database Creation and Data Loading
- Designed a MySQL database to store the cleaned data, ensuring relational structure and optimized queries.
- Established a connection between Python and MySQL Server using the pymysql library.
# Created separate tables for:
- Customers
- ExchangeRates
- Products
- Sales
- Stores
- Imported the preprocessed data into MySQL using Python scripts.

# 3. SQL Queries for Insights
- Formulated and executed 10 SQL queries to extract key business insights.
- # Queries addressed critical business questions, such as:
- Customer Analysis: Identifying high-value customers and purchase patterns.
- Product Performance: Determining top-performing products.
- Store Insights: Analyzing store-specific sales and operational metrics.

# 4.Data Visualization with Power BI
- Established a connection between MySQL Server and Power BI using ODBC Data Sources (as direct connection via credentials encountered compatibility issues).
- Imported and modeled data in Power BI to create insightful and interactive dashboards.

# 5.Dashboard Features
- Created a variety of visualizations to uncover trends and performance metrics:
- Store Performance Analysis: Evaluated sales by store size and operational data.
- Geographical Analysis: Highlighted sales performance across regions.
- Sales Trends: Showcased trends over time and by product categories.

# 6.Technologies Used
Languages: Python (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code), SQL
Database: MySQL Server
Visualization Tool: Power BI
Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Pymysql

This project demonstrates expertise in data cleaning, relational database management, SQL querying, and data visualizationâ€”providing comprehensive insights to support business decision-making.
